# Hero's Journey

I recently attended the [Real Skills Conference](https://realskillsconference.com/), a 2-hour digial conference, and was struck by this line [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/) said as he closed out the conference.

> ### "This is not a hero's journey, it's our journey."

The timing of hearing it right before starting the long weekend on which we honor the memory of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. was auspicious.

Heros only achieve that status after having done something others deem heroic. One becomes a hero by doing the work, by earning it. By standing up and taking a chance.

We have too many pressing issues in front of us to sit around and wait for a hero to ride to our aid. It's time to find the others and make a ruckus.

We are all in this together. There are no heros coming to our rescue, we are our own heros.
