  <aside class='publish-date'><%= publish_time_tag %></aside>
<p>It’s a new year, a new decade(?), so you know what that means: it’s trend time! We dusted off our crystal ball over at <a href="https://www.blueion.com/" target="_blank">Blue Ion</a> (not to be confused with our Cristal Ball) and took a peek at the future of marketing. 
Here’s what we saw.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Techlash: The Fallout</h3>
<h4>The future is private.</h4>
<br/>
<h3>The Robots Cometh</h3>
<h4>Automation, but for real this time.</h4>
<br/>
<h3>Venture into the Dark Forests</h3>
<h4>Channels with a subscriber list and more control.</h4>
<br/>
<h3>Fly Your Flag</h3>
<h4>Lay claim to what to own and share it wide.</h4>
<br/>
<h3>Own the Moment</h3>
<h4>Meet customers where they are, not where you want them to be.</h4>
<br/>
<p>Click over to the <a href="https://www.blueion.com/blog/2020-tech-and-marketing-trends-distilled/" target="_blank">Blue Ion blog</a> to read even more of what the magic 8 ball told us. However, if you don't, simply remember three things: Respect your customers. Own your channels. Tell your story.</p>
